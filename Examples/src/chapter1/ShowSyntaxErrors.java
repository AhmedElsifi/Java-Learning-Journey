        in programming we have 3 types of errors :
        Syntax Error : when you write a wrong syntax in your program , 
            gets detectet before you run your program and the program won't run unless you fix it.
        Runtime Error : when you write a correct syntax but you write a wrong expression like dividing by zero ,
            gets detected when you run your program and the program will run untill it faces that error.
        Logic Error : when you write a correct syntax and correct expressions , but the logic is wrong so yo won't get your desired output , 
            the compiler wont detect it at all.
