# Java Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository is dedicated to my progress in mastering Java.  
It includes:
- âœ… Core Java fundamentals (syntax, variables, loops, conditions)  
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)  
- âœ… Data Structures & Algorithms (implemented in Java)  
- âœ… Hands-on exercises and practice problems  
- âœ… Notes in Markdown format for easy reference  

The goal of this repo is to build a strong foundation in Java that supports my university courses and future full-stack development journey.
