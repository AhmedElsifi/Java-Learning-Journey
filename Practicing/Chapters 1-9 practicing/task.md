## **Project Name:** ‚ÄúPrime Academy Simulator‚Äù

**Concept:**
You‚Äôre building a mini simulation system for a fictional academy for ‚Äúprime minds‚Äù . The system will manage students, classes, exams, and performance stats. It‚Äôs modular, mathematical, and object-oriented ‚Äî exactly the kind of playground to apply the first 9 chapters.

### **How Each Chapter Fits In**

| Chapter                                      | How it applies in the project                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Introduction to Computers, Programs, Java | Create the main Java program structure, console interaction, input/output handling.                                                     |
| 2. Elementary Programming                    | Variables for student info, basic calculations (grades, averages).                                                                      |
| 3. Selections                                | Conditional logic: e.g., pass/fail students, assign honors based on grades.                                                             |
| 4. Math Functions, Characters, Strings       | Compute GPAs, string manipulations for names, ID formatting, sorting students alphabetically.                                           |
| 5. Loops                                     | Iterating over lists of students, classes, exams; printing reports.                                                                     |
| 6. Methods                                   | Reusable methods: calculate average, print report, assign grades, etc.                                                                  |
| 7. Single-Dimensional Arrays                 | Store student scores in 1D arrays for individual exams.                                                                                 |
| 8. Multidimensional Arrays                   | Store all students‚Äô scores across multiple exams in a 2D array.                                                                         |
| 9. Objects and Classes                       | Classes like `Student`, `Exam`, `Course`, with instance/static variables, constructors, getters/setters, immutable fields, and methods. |

### **Core Classes & Objects**

1. **Student**

   - Fields: `name`, `id`, `birthDate` (object), `examScores` (1D array), etc.
   - Methods: calculate GPA, print info, etc.

2. **BirthDate**

   - Immutable date object (practice immutability).

3. **Course / Exam**

   - Fields: course name, max score, student scores (2D array).
   - Methods: add scores, calculate averages, assign grades.

4. **Academy**

   - Manages all students, courses, exams.
   - Static fields for total students, total courses.

---

### **Features / Mini Tasks**

- Add students with personal info.
- Assign courses and exams.
- Input exam scores.
- Print student report cards (using loops + string formatting).
- Compute course averages and top performers (use math functions + loops + selections).
- Practice **passing objects to methods**: e.g., a method that updates exam scores by passing `Student` objects.
- Experiment with **immutable objects**: BirthDate objects cannot be changed once created.
- Use **arrays** for exam scores (1D) and multiple exams (2D).
- Implement a **menu-driven console system** using selections and loops.

---

### **Stretch Goals (Prime-Level Challenges)**

- Sort students by GPA or alphabetical order (strings + arrays).
- Track history of score changes using stack-like logic.
- Add static methods to compute overall academy statistics.
- Optionally, serialize data to save/load students.

üí° **Why this is perfect for you:**

- Covers **all 9 chapters**.
- Mixes **mathematical reasoning** (grades, GPAs, averages).
- Lets you apply **OOP principles** fully.
- Gives room to **experiment creatively** without being mundane.
