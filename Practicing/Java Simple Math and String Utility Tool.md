Create a Java program that acts as a **Simple Math and String Utility Tool**. The program should:

1.  **Display a welcome message** (Chapter 1).
2.  Prompt the user to enter **two numbers** (use `Scanner`) and **one string** (Chapter 2).
3.  Calculate and print the following for the two numbers (Chapters 2 & 4):
    - Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient (be mindful of integer division), and Remainder.
    - The result of raising the first number to the power of the second number (use `Math.pow`).
    - The square root of the first number (use `Math.sqrt`).
4.  Based on the value of the first number, use an **`if-else`** or **`switch`** statement (Chapter 3) to print:
    - `"Positive"` if the number is greater than 0.
    - `"Negative"` if the number is less than 0.
    - `"Zero"` if the number is 0.
5.  Analyze the entered string (Chapter 4) and print:
    - Its length.
    - The string in uppercase.
    - The string in lowercase.
    - Whether the string starts with a letter (use `Character.isLetter` on the first character). Print `"Starts with a letter"` or `"Does not start with a letter"`.
